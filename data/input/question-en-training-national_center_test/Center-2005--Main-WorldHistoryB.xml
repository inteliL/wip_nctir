                              The Qing established the Lifan Yuan [Board for the Administration of Outlying Regions] in the center to carry out indirect governance of realms outside the main part of China, such as <uText id="U30"><label>(4)</label>Mongolia, Tibet and Qinghai</uText> - in other words, the fanbu [barbarian areas].In doing so, it was particularly careful about placating and controlling Mongolia, which had superior military capacity.For example, in terms of legislation, it formulated a legal code called the Mengguli, which took into consideration the customs and traditions of Mongolia and was separate from the Qing lu [statutes].In addition, the Mongoliannobility was permitted to establish its own unique legal code and it was this that was actually applied until the first half of the 18th century.However, the Mengguli began to be applied from the latter half of the 18th century, and its content became more similar to that of the Qing lu.Factors behind this include the successful capture of the Zunghar Khanate by <blank id="B17"><label>(5)</label></blank> and the "indigenization" of Mongolia in order to save it from the advance of <uText id="U31"><label>(6)</label>Russia</uText>.<br />

                              The concept of moderninternational law, based on the premise of national sovereignty and the equality of nations, was born in Europe in the 17th century.However, it is not the case that this ideal became universal immediately, and the sovereignty of the world deemed to be outside Europe was not necessarily acknowledged.This tendency became even more overt during the Age of Imperialism in the 19th century.Triggered by the First World War, numerous international organizations such as the <uText id="U32"><label>(7)</label>League of Nations</uText> were established, and it was hoped that they would play a role in maintaining order in international relations.However, it remained difficult to remedy the power politics of the great powers and efforts to <uText id="U33"><label>(8)</label>coordinate the interests of various nations</uText> continued, even after the Second World War.In order to resolve <uText id="U34"><label>(9)</label>the problems that the world faces today</uText>, it is essential to conduct further dialogue and formulate appropriate rules.<br />
