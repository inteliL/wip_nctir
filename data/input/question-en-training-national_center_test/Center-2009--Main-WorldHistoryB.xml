                              Writing about trends among highly-educated people during the Ming period, the Qing period scholar Zhào Yì states that from the <uText id="U1"><label>(1)</label>Tang and Song periods onwards, most of those who excelled in culture and the arts were those who had passed the Imperial examinations</uText>, but in the <uText id="U2"><label>(2)</label>Ming period</uText>, there was a shift toward figures outside the bureaucracy.The painter Tang Yin, who lived during the middle part of the Ming period, can truly be described as a key figure from that transitional period. While achieving outstanding marks in the Imperial examinations, he became embroiled in an unfortunate incident; after the path to advancement was barred to him, he made his living from painting in Suzhou, while living a carefree lifestyle.From the middle to the late Ming period, a succession of artists and writers outside the bureaucracy emerged after culture matured in cities, due to <uText id="U3"><label>(3)</label>the development of commerce and industry, focused mainly on the Jiangnan region</uText>, with pictures and publications coming to possess wide-ranging value as products.<br />

                              Andrew Carnegie, who was called "the King of Steel", was a figure who experienced the changes in occupations and labor resulting from modernization during the course of his lifetime. In 1848, his family emigrated from Scotland to the United States of America, taking him with them.The factor behind this move was the predicament faced by the family business in woolen cloth, due to the <uText id="U7"><label>(7)</label>spread of cheap cotton cloth produced in factories</uText>.After working as a telegraph operator on the railroad, he became an industrialist and achieved success in the steel industry using new technologies.<uText id="U8"><label>(8)</label>The transition to a large-scale industrial structure</uText> during this period brought about a major transformation in approaches to occupations and labor, with sharp rises in the number of people switching from being craftsmen and farmers to being factory workers, as well as the emergence of white-collar workers.Moreover, the escalation of <uText id="U9"><label>(9)</label>labor problems</uText> was one consequence of this.Even at Carnegie's steel company, the expansion of production led to frequent industrial disputes.<br />

                              The people living in Europe during the Middle Ages were eager to enter heaven <uText id="U24"><label>(7)</label>after death</uText>.During the period of <uText id="U25"><label>(8)</label>the Carolingian dynasty of Francia</uText>, the Roman Catholic Church preached that the religious cleansing of sins was necessary in order to achieve salvation after death.Accordingly, the custom of atonement for one's sins, in which a person acknowledged and repented of their sins, and made amends for them, spread; moreover, primarily in the <uText id="U26"><label>(9)</label>monasteries</uText>, it became a requirement for the living to pray for the dead to ascend to heaven.These requirements for prayer and atonement for one's sins gradually grew. During the Protestant Reformation, the sale of indulgences (pardons), which were deemed to grant forgiveness for sins, was criticized and it was argued that the salvation of the soul could only be achieved through faith.<br />
