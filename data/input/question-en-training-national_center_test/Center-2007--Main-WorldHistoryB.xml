                              Santiago de Compostela, which is located in the Galicia region in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, is an important place of pilgrimage in <uText id="U1"><label>(1)</label>Christianity</uText>.In the 9th century, a grave believed to be that of James, one of the apostles of Jesus, was discovered there and it became a Christian religious site, which began to be visited by many pilgrims from across Europe.A pilgrimage route called the "Way of St. James" developed and James came to be venerated as the patron saint of <uText id="U2"><label>(2)</label>pilgrims and travelers</uText>.At the same time, as the <uText id="U3"><label>(3)</label>Reconquista (reconquest and recovery of territory)</uText> on the Iberian Peninsula gathered pace, he also began to be positioned as the patron saint of Christians fighting against infidels.

                              There are quite a few inscriptions by pilgrims on the stone pillars at <uText id="U4"><label>(4)</label>Angkor Wat</uText> in Cambodia.There are even a few written in ink by visitors from such Japanese provinces as Hizen, Higo and Sakai, during the first half of the 17th century.Of these, the inscription by Morimoto Ukondayu Kazufusa (see <ref target="D14">picture</ref> below) is particularly famous; in 1632, he wrote that he made offerings to four images of the Buddha, to pray for his parents’ future years.It is said that it was then that Kazufusa copied down the arrangement of the temple buildings and brought it back home, describing it as the famous Jetavana (Gion Shoja) Buddhist monastery that appears in the "Tale of the Heike".It appears that pilgrims from Japan at that time mistook Angkor Wat for a place in India where <uText id="U5"><label>(5)</label>Siddhartha Gautama</uText> taught.At any rate, the only reason why it became possible to visit this area as a "Buddhist religious site" is that trading ships licensed by the shogunate <uText id="U6"><label>(6)</label>at that time were traveling between Japan and Southeast Asia</uText>.

                              Horses were domesticated around 6,000 years ago, with horses beginning to pull chariots in about 2,000 BCE.When horse riding (see <ref target="D17">picture</ref> below) spread due to improvements in the bits attached to bridles, <uText id="U10"><label>(1)</label>nomadic tribes on horseback</uText> emerged on the Eurasian continent.Their elusive character became a major threat to sedentary agricultural societies, so troops mounted on horseback were organized to counteract them.Rulers who sought good horses also emerged, such as <uText id="U11"><label>(2)</label>Emperor Wu of Han</uText>, who sought Ferghana horses, and horses became an important item in trade between agricultural peoples and nomads.Moreover, the <uText id="U12"><label>(3)</label>Mongol Empire</uText> expanded its territory through its powerful horseback-mounted troops and developed a post horse system, which facilitated the traffic of people and goods across the whole of Eurasia.

                              There are two theories regarding the domestication of sheep.One is that they were first domesticated <uText id="U13"><label>(4)</label>approximately 9,000 years ago</uText> in western Asia, in order to supplement the unstable agricultural economy.The other is that nomads managing domestic animals emerged as the hunting peoples of inland Asia followed flocks of wild sheep and acquired the skills of milking and castrating them.At any rate, domesticated sheep were prized by both agricultural peoples and nomads as "walking" portable food, while their wood was treasured as <uText id="U14"><label>(5)</label>the raw material for making woolen cloth</uText>.In Mongolia, spilling the blood of a sheep on the land was viewed as taboo, a belief that developed because <uText id="U15"><label>(6)</label>Genghis Khan stipulated in a law that "a different method than that used in Islam shall be used"</uText>.Thus, perspectives on nature and religion were also reflected in the relationship with sheep.<br />

                              During the early Western Han dynasty, Jia Yi criticized the "rule of law" under the First Emperor, writing that, "he augmented his own power, made the penal code harsher, put military might ahead of the path of humanity and justice, and used tyranny as his primary means of ruling the country".During the <uText id="U18"><label>(1)</label>Ming dynasty</uText>, Zhou Jingxin said, "The length of time for which a nation prospers depends on its level of virtue. The <uText id="U19"><label>(2)</label>Han, Tang and Song dynasties lasted a long time, while dynasties such as Qin and Sui were short-lived</uText>; those that govern justly are long-lasting, while those that betray that principle are cut short".In other words, the "virtue" of its rulers was deemed to determine the fate of a nation. It was thought that key to a peaceful reign lay in the outstanding moral character of an emperor or dynasty, even if control over the nation had been gained by means of military might.The principle of "rule by virtue", which lasted for a long time in China, until the fall of the Qing dynasty <uText id="U20"><label>(3)</label>in the early 20th century</uText>, can be seen in this.<br />

                              Various legends surround the founding of the United States of America.For example, the tale that a woman called Betsy Ross made the Stars and Stripes flag, which is the <uText id="U21"><label>(4)</label>national flag of the United States of America</uText>, at the request of George Washington is believed to be a legend that soon became widely believed to be true, stemming from a story that began to be told almost a hundred years after the nation achieved independence(see <ref target="D22">picture</ref> below).Moreover, the <uText id="U22"><label>(5)</label>Declaration of Independence document</uText> contained in the National Archives was not drawn up on the Fourth of July, which became American Independence Day; in fact, the document was signed the following month.However, both the former Presidents Adams and Jefferson died on the Fourth of July, on the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, so that date became even more sacrosanct.Subsequently, <uText id="U23"><label>(6)</label>President Monroe</uText> also died on the Fourth of July, on the 55th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.
